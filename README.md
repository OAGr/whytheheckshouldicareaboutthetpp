Why the Heck Should I Care about the TPP? is a simple web application to
instruct people on why the heck they should care about the TPP.  In
/facts one can add a bunch of facts about the TPP, and in /questions,
one can add a bunch of questions (like "I'm not impressed", or "Huh"?)
that the user responds.

Feel free to re-purpose this code for any means desired, unless it is to
promote existing copywrite legislation in the TPP, whereby we will be
severely saddened.
